# Nodes and Child nodes in 2D

Everything in the `Redot` engine is tied to `node` system. These useful gameobjects allow us to place many useful components in game development from data holders, 2D graphics, and even audio systems.
These are just some 2D nodes we will use:
*   Camera2D
*   Node2d
*   Sprite2D
*   AnimatedSrpite2D
*   CollisionShape2D
*   CPUParticles2D

You may notice most nodes have the 2D tag at the end of its name. The 3D nodes operate more or less the same, only positioning and rotations will be dramatically different.

When creating a new scene, `Redot` prompts us with a question, asking what we want the root node of our scene to be.

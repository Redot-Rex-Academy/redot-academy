## Create your initial main scene
Every game require a scene that is loaded when the game starts. For our purpose we call
this our `main` scene and we will simply make it a 3D scene for now.

Follow the [Create your initial 3D scene](/pages/tutorials/set-up-initial-3d-scene) tutorial, then come back to this track.

## Creating your Player
Every game where you control a character needs some kind of character controller.
We will call ours for `Player` and we will make a unique scene by the same name.

Follow the [3rd Person 3D Character](/pages/tutorials/character_controller_3d_3rdp)
tutorial and then come back to this track.
